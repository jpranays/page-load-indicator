# 🚦 Page Load Indicator

A lightweight, privacy-first Chrome Extension that displays an **in-page loading progress bar** during full page reloads. Perfect for reducing user confusion and avoiding accidental double-clicks on slower or less responsive sites.



## ✨ Features

* 📊 **Top-fixed loading progress bar** => shown on full page reloads
* 🧼 **Clean, non-intrusive design** => that doesn’t interfere with page layout
* ⚙️ **Zero configuration needed** => works automatically on every site
* 🔒 **Privacy-respecting** => no data collection or network interception



## 💡 Motivation

While modern browsers offer subtle tab indicators during navigation, they often go unnoticed, especially when users are focused on the page content. This can result in:

* Clicking multiple times out of impatience
* Wondering if the site is stuck or broken
* Poor UX on slower networks or heavy pages

**Page Load Indicator** fixes this by injecting a lightweight progress bar directly into the page, giving users immediate, visible feedback that something is happening.

## 🧩 Usage
